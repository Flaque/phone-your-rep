Put yo' rep in yo' phone!

## Overview
This script builds [vcards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard) using
the [vobject](https://github.com/eventable/vobject) python library.

## Setup

The script at the moment expects there to be a `vcards` folder in the
project. So run:

`mkdir vcards`

You'll also need the dependencies, which at the moment are `vobject`
and `usadress`.

```
pip install vobject
pip install usadress
```
